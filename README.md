# SlotEsp32
WARNING: the magnetic sensor TLE493D-P3B6 A0 is the version 3 silicon available on Digikey or mouser. Please note the older version (P2) has issues , some other guys have been able to make it working, but I was not.  Please note, the last part (A0) of the part number is related to the address, if you purchase TLE493D-P3B6 A0 it will have 0x5D, A1 it will have 0x13, and so on, please double check the part number you ordered, and the datasheet for the proper address (I think we are using the 7 bit address )
